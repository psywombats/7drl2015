Follow these rules and learn 2 event!!
================================================================================

I'm working on this and it'll get longer when there are enough maps to put
together.

Teleports:
Teleportation is handled via object. Add an object on the teleport square, set
it to type "teleport" and give it the following properties: id - the database
key of the map to teleport to (not its filename), x - the x-coord (in tiles) to
teleport to on target map, y - the y-coord (in tiles) to teleport to. Keep in
mind that the engine counts y from the upper left starting from 0. You can
mouse over a square to figure out its coords.

Event properties:
"key" - event key in the database
"name" - the name of the object, what it's referred to in cutscene events
"respawns" - causes the enemy to come back if the hero does something dumb

Map properties:
none so far

SYSTEM: SNARKY: This is disappointing. Just a bunch of rats and moldy potions so far. No treasure.\nHERO: Well at least the potions are useful.\nIDIOT: And I wouldn't call that tongue-covered naga 'just a bunch of rats' either! This place is insane!\nSECOND: It's not a natural place. It's tethered to the spirit realm, somehow.\nIDIOT: Spirit realm or not, I'm staying well away from those ugly things.\nHERO: Strange, the walls on this floor are covered with books.\nSNARKY: Books aren't much a treasure either.

SYSTEM: HERO: This place looks so cramped on the inside. Before we came in I thought it was the size of a castle.\nSNARKY: It still could be. I feel torrents of magic running through the walls here.\nSECOND: And I can feel some malicious presence.\nIDIOT: I usually leave malicious presences alone.\nHERO: IDIOT, come on, we'll get to the bottom of this house-castle, find out whatever's down there, then leave. Done.\nSNARKY: And hopefully pick up some treasure on the way.

SYSTEM: The sagas of Old Calcedonia spoke of a realm beyond the aurora of the north. Violet, who first set forth in the spirit realm ten years ago, has returned. She tells a tale of worms that walk, dolls that dance, evil figures that appear from nowhere and blot out the sun. The sagas told of a time when the barrier would be broken, and it seems that time is now.\nA band of heroes heads to the north, lead by HERO-FULL as SECOND-FULL guides the way. Accompanied by SNARKY-FULL and IDIOT-FULL, their expedition has two objectives: seal the spirit realm, and return alive.

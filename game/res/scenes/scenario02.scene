SYSTEM: The vast dungeons that stretch beneath Escharlot Manor held prisoners of the ancient regimes of Calcedonia. The modern era has seen them fill with foul beasts, insane cultists, and a fine array of the most terrifying implements of torture known to man.\nIt is said that at the bottom of this hellish complex are the three separate tombs of the Regicide. A man from the dark past of Caldedonia. A man seen just recently in the heart of the capital. The Regicide has arisen to complete his work, and the damned have risen with him. Only a small team of sellswords, hired by IDIOT-FULL and lead by the renowned HERO-FULL, has any chance of stopping him.

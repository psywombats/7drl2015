SYSTEM: Welcome to Academic Rogue.\nPlease retrieve the Legendary Statue of MacGuffin from floor 13!\nMove with the numpad with [5] to wait. You can optionally enable vikeys movement, number row movement, and iopkl;,./ movement in config.cfg.\nOther controls: e[x]amine, [tab] or [escape] for items, [01234567890] to activate skills.\nYou may set up camp for the night by pressing [c]. This can be done once per floor. This will move all your items, heal you, and level up!\nSpellbooks grant skills that can be used a certain number of times per night. Weapons work the same way (although they will be autoequipped when you use the skill). Carrying duplicate books or weapons does nothing.

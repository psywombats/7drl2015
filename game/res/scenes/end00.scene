Is that really you, Kolstya?\nNATHNIEL: More strange people from nowhere!\nKOLSTYA: Nathaniel, it's Kyrsta, my sister! I thought you were dead! Kyrsta!\nKYRSTA: And you are dead! I lit your funeral pyre myself after you were killed by the dark king!\nKOLSTYA: Dark king? We just killed the dark king!\nJACK: No, we killed the ghost of the great sage!\nQETZ: The great sage?

 * Okay, this is a little weird, but this maps virtual button presses to command
 * intentions. Something like if you press the virtual A-button, this interprets
 * that as a confirm. However, in most games this only exists as a single blob
 * and never changes. This is here so that multiple maps can be plug-and-played
 * for testing purposes. A default implementation should be kicking around
 * somewhere.<br><br>
 * 
 * Also of note: these should be specific to a context, so the command map for
 * menus shouldn't be the same as gameplay, etc.<br><br>
 * 
 * As of 2013-10-20, no longer operates on a listener basis. Instead, does
 * translation like a normal map.
